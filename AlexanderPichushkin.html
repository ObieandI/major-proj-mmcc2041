                    <p> Alexander Pichushkin was born on April 9th, 1971, in Moscow Russia. He had a normal childhood,
                        however at the age of 4, he suffered a head injury due to a swing-set incident. This ultimately
                        resulted in Pichushkin exhibiting abnormal and “unlike” behaviours such as impulsive decision
                        making and violent outbursts <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Alexander_Pichushkin" target="_blank">(Criminal Minds Wiki, n.d.)</a>, <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/creepy-facts-alexander-pichushkin/amandasedlakhevener" target="_blank">(Sedlak-Hevener, n.d.)</a>. Alexander
                        Pichushkin was originally nicknamed as the Bitsa Park Maniac, however when the police discovered
                        how he liked to commemorate his victims, Pichushkin was branded with the Chessboard Killer title
                        by media outlets <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-serialkiller/russian-chessboard-killer-convicted-of-48-murders-idUSL247048420071024" target="_blank">(Lowe, 2007)</a>. Pichushkin would keep a journal where he drew a chessboard
                        containing the dates each murder took place, on each square piece of the chessboard.
                        <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/creepy-facts-alexander-pichushkin/amandasedlakhevener" target="_blank">(Sedlak-Hevener, n.d.)</a> Pichushkin was first introduced to chess by his grandfather and would
                        often sit at the park playing chess and drinking alcohol, although Pichushkin was good at chess,
                        he found that alcohol would make him better. Thus, his method of killing would start with a
                        drinking invitation, and later luring his victims to a quieter side of the park where he
                        proceeded to attack them from behind. Pichushkin was arrested after a colleague left his phone
                        number with a relative in case of any emergencies. Pichuskin invited his colleague into the
                        woods, where she was later found murdered due to phone tracing by detectives. At the time of his
                        arrest, Pichushkin occupied a total of 61 out of 64 pieces. His goal consisted of surpassing the
                        most notorious serial killer at the time, known as the Rostov Ripper, which mutilated a total
                        of 52 victims. He often described killing as “falling in love” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-serialkiller/russian-chessboard-killer-convicted-of-48-murders-idUSL247048420071024" target="_blank">(Lowe, 2007)</a>.
