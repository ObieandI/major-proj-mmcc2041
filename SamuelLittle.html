                    <p> The FBI have described Samuel Little to be “the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history” <a
                            href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/samuel-little-most-prolific-serial-killer-in-us-history-100619"
                            target="_blank">(FBI, 2020)</a> with a
                        total confession to 93 murders over a 35-year period from 1970 – 2005. Whilst Little has
                        confessed the 93 murders,
                        the FBI have only verified 50 of those confessions however do believe all his confession are
                        credible <a
                            href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/samuel-little-most-prolific-serial-killer-in-us-history-100619"
                            target="_blank">(FBI, 2020)</a>.
                        The vast majority of Samuel Little’s victims were marked as accidental deaths, overdoses, or
                        death from undetermined
                        causes. Little himself described the women he picked as “women whose eyes were half-dead
                        already” and “had been
                        waiting for him to finish the job” <a
                            href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/how-serial-killer-samuel-little-was-caught.html"
                            target="_blank">(Lauren, 2018)</a>. Due to the vast majority of these women coming from low
                        socioeconomic status, and a high percentage of the women being African American, their
                        disappearances were often
                        overlooked or did not receive the same news coverage of murders regarding wealthy white women <a
                            href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/how-serial-killer-samuel-little-was-caught.html"
                            target="_blank">(Lauren, 2018)</a>. This
                        resulted in the FBI’s request for assistance from the general populace in connecting the
                        drawings Little drew, and
                        the detailed interviews of Little to the victims. These interviews contained information on the
                        murder, the
                        description of the victim including an approximated weight and height from Little himself, the
                        events that followed
                        to the murder and the location the murder took place. The FBI disclosed information regarding
                        the potential murders
                        on their website with a total of 48 victims they initially requested assistance in finding, now
                        40 <a

                        Little died in his cell at the age of 80, leaving any further memories of potential victims
                        behind <a
