                    <p> Pedro Rodrigues Filho was born on 17th July 1954, Santa Rita do Sapucaí, Brazil with a brain
                        injury after his father
                        abused his mother while she was pregnant with him. Many believe that this alongside the murder
                        of his mother by his
                        father, and the murder of his lover by gang members fuelled Filho’s mission of killing
                        criminals. Filho killed his
                        first 10 people just before the age of 18 <a

                            2020)</a>, with his list continuously growing throughout his
                        years. Whilst Filho was a serial killer, some articles and news outlets deemed him as one of the
                        “nicer” serial
                        killers, some even comparing him to the real-life version of Dexter <a
                            href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/pedro-rodrigues-filho" target="_blank">(Interesting,
                            2020)</a>. From then, Filho began his
                        full-time criminal career, killing cartel and other gang members. In 1973 he was finally
                        arrested after several
                        murders. Whilst his total number of confirmed killings is 71, 47 of those took place while he
                        was incarcerated.
                        Despite Filho’s track record of murders within the prison and his sentence of 126 years, he was
                        released in 2007.
                        Filho was arrested once again in 2011 and was released again in 2018. Filho described the
                        process of his murders
                        that took time in prison, stating that his targets were often those he felt “deserved
                        retribution” <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/pedro-rodrigues-filho"
                            target="_blank">(Interesting, 2020)</a>. In a recent podcast, Filho states that he would not
                        kill again unless his life or his family’s life was in
                        immediate danger <a
