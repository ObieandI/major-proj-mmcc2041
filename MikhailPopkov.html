                    <p> Mikhail Viktorovich Popkov was a Russian police officer and infamous serial killer born on March
                        7, 1964. Popkov ‘s reign of terror throughout Russia lasted between 1992 - 2010 <a

                        and it is believed that his victims resembled traits which reminded him of his alcoholic and
                        abusive mother. He hinted however that his murder spree began due to his wife’s infidelity
                        <a href="https://genwhypod.com/blogs/the-generation-why-podcast-blog/russian-serial-killer-cop-mikhail-the-werewolf-popkov-confesses-to-two-more-murders"
                            target="_blank">(Sinsiwa, 2020)</a>. Popkov would often wait outside bars for intoxicated
                        women and use his police
                        uniform and vehicle to gain their trust. He would use whichever weapon he could acquire from the
                        evidence locker and wipe his fingerprints off after using them. He later described the process
                        as a decision he had to make based on the victim’s behaviour and attitude during the car ride.
                        If they had a ‘bad attitude’ he would take them into the woods and brutally murder them. Popkov
                        was notorious for the gruesome crime scenes he would often create, thus giving him the nickname
                        “The Werewolf”. Popkov later participated in an internal DNA testing by the police force, which
                        tested around 3500 police officers <a
                            href="https://genwhypod.com/blogs/the-generation-why-podcast-blog/russian-serial-killer-cop-mikhail-the-werewolf-popkov-confesses-to-two-more-murders"
                            target="_blank">(Sinsiwa, 2020)</a>. Popkov’s DNA matched to bodily fluid found
                        on one of the victims, and he was immediately taken into custody. When he was arrested on June
                        23, 2012, many of his co-workers and close relative were shocked, describing him as “very
                        charming, likeable, funny, and the life of the party” <a

                        interviews, Popkov stated he wanted to clean the city of immoral women, and that he had a
                        “desire to punish them” <a
