## About the Website

This project investigates four prolific serial killers from across the globe — Samuel Little, Alexander Pichushkin, Mikhail Popkov, and Pedro Rodrigues Filho. The website presents their backgrounds, psychological profiles, and criminal patterns in a visually structured, accessible format. The site includes thumbnail images, in-depth written content, and source referencing for factual accuracy.

The aim was to create a compelling, research-based site that educates users about the societal patterns and investigative challenges surrounding these individuals.
